v1.51d

Known issues for v1.51d
- Ties currently display the first header item in the tie only.
- There is no API to modify notification settings for triggers, so you will continue to get email notification. There is no way to fix this.
- Attempt at allowing edit failed; there is no way to track previous response yet, needed to fix the vote counts (ie, to decrement).
